The keep was quiet at night.
A lantern flickered in the tower.
Someone moved behind the curtain.
Was someone watching?

River.txt:
The river flowed very gently.
 It reflected the moonlight.
 Nearby, an owl hooted.
 The forest seemed alive.

Koob.txt:
The old book lay on the table.
Its pages were yellowed and torn.
A card fell out as it was opened.
